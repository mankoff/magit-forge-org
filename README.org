Edit Magit Forge issues with Org Mode

Desired behavior:
+ New posts are in =(org-mode)=
+ Submit no longer =C-c C-c=, but instead =C-u C-c C-c=
+ On submit, export to markdown, and submit that

* Implementation

+ With help from:  https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13ws42w/how_can_i_edit_magit_forge_issue_comments_in_org/
